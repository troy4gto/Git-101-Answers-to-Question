Questions: 

    How do you see the files changed within each commit from git log?
    How do you see the contents of what changed within each file from the git log?
    What does HEAD refer to in the context of git? (Not to be confused with the "HEAD<<<<" one observes within merge conflict)




1. " You can see the changes in the log using this command: 'git log -- stat'. This command line brings up the changes, and shows plus and minus signs to show what was added or removed. "
2. " command: 'git log -- patch' shows you the content that changed within the commits. "
3. " 'HEAD' refers to the current branch you are in, in a commit object."
